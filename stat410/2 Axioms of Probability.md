Each **outcome** in a sample space is called an element or a member of the sample space, or simply a **sample point**.
	Sample spaces with a large or infinite number of sample points are best described by a statement or rule.
	Statement example: the possible outcomes of an experiment are the set of cities in the world whose populations are over 1 million. The sample space is written as S = {x | x is a city whose population is over 1 million}.
	Rule example: If S is the set of all points (x, y) on the boundary or the interior of a circle of radius 2 centering at the origin, we write the sample space as: S = {(x, y)|x 2 + y 2 â‰¤ 2 2}
