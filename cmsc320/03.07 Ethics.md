It **is::is/is not** possible to reproduce training data from model weights

When dealing with human data, think if there are human biases (either race/gender as **predictor** or bad **proxy**, eg "arrested" as "criminal").

**Instrumental convergence** is the idea that sufficiently advanced intelligent systems with a wide variety of terminal goals would pursue very similar instrumental goals.
> A terminal goal (also referred to as an "intrinsic goal" or "intrinsic value") is something that an agent values for its own sake (an "end in itself"), while an instrumental goal is something that an agent pursues to make it more likely that it will achieve its terminal goals (a "means to an end").
> eg self-preservation and goal integrity
