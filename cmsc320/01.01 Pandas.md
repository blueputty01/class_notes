A series is a **one dimensional array of data with an index**.
> index is most commonly integers

Never access a series by **index** 

**`apply`** takes a function as an argument and returns a series with that function applie takes a function as an argument and returns a series with that function applied

Never **loop** over a series.

Dataframes are a collection of **series**.

To go from a dataframe to a series: `df["Column Name"]`
To create a series of booleans: `df["Column Name"] > 10`
To then use that to filter the dataframe: **`df[df["Column Name"] > 10]`**
To value count by group: `df.groupby("Some Column")["Some other column"].value_counts()`
