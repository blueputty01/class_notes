# Deterrence

decreased crime by 17% 

# Prelude To Incapacitation: Superoffenders

small increases in incarceration cause small decreases in crime, and only very large increases in incarceration are capable of causing very large decreases in crime.

# incapacitation 

# aftereffects

it makes sense that released prisoners will find it very hard to re-integrate into the world

Summary
Long prison sentences can theoretically decrease crime through deterrence, incapacitation, or rehabilitory aftereffects.

Deterrence effects are so weak that we might as well round them off to zero.

Incapacitation effects are strong. The exact strength depends on how many people are already in prison, but a reasonable estimate at the current margin is that each prisoner-year prevents one violent crime and six property crimes.

The magnitude of aftereffects are unclear, and probably range from slightly beneficial to detrimental depending on the population and length of prison term being studied.

One contrarian researcher (Roodman) argues that aftereffects are so large that they approximately cancel out the benefits of incapacitation, and he has some reanalyzed studies that support his position. This is the only credible argument for why prisons wouldn’t decrease crime at all, but AFAIK only this one person believes it.

Everyone else, when they say that prison “doesn’t decrease crime”, is either forgetting about incapacitation, or exaggerating their position that it’s a bad and not-so-effective way of decreasing crime.

A more sober estimate is that a 10% increase in incarceration rates decreases crime rates by 3%.

If you try to do a cost-benefit analysis of the marginal unit of extra incarceration, using only the easily quantifiable inputs, it ends up very slightly positive under the most generous possible assumptions (very weak aftereffects, cheap incarceration costs, zero consideration of effects on prisoners themselves) but negative otherwise.

Prison is less cost-effective than other methods of decreasing crime at most current margins. If people weren’t attracted by the emotional punch of how “tough-on-crime” it feels, they would probably want to divert justice system resources away from prisons into other things like police and courts.

I’m putting this last one in bold because I don’t want people’s takeaway from this post to be “Aha, prison decreases crime after all, we should do much more of it!” I think prison has greater than zero effect, but that untargeted longer sentences aren’t the most effective or cost-effective solution to crime.
