- Attorney asked Matthew Schrag to investigate Alzheimer's disease drug Simufilam
- Led to him discovering that UMN's Sylvain Lesne's research on plaques being cause of Alzehimer's may be fraudulent
	- consequence may be wasted NIH funds, set back research
- amyloid hypothesis: holds that A$\beta$ clumps in brain tissue are a primary cause of the illness
	- amyloid mafia: people complain that other potential causes are drowned out in this noise
- toxic oligomers: subtypes of A$\beta$ that dissolve in some bodily fluids started being seen as chief culprit
- UMN team discovered A$\beta*56$ that caused rats' recall capacity to plummet
	- led by Karen Ashe, who had already worked on transgenic mice that produced human amyloid substances that formed plaques in the animal (well known & respected) 
- came about from pubpeer (site used to point out errors in papers)
- reproducibility problem: some is going to occur reproducing, but stuff like image analysis should be reproducible
- raised eyebrows even before Schrag's investigation: Lesne claimed to have used "purified" AB56, but these are notoriously unstable
- **Journals are often uninterested in negative results, and researchers can be reluctant to contradict a famous investigator**.
