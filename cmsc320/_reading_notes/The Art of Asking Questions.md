Self-Report can mislead!

implicit association tests promise harder to fake. but this led us further away from the truth! eg for 2016 election results he predicted Clinton would win by a lot

# if you wanna know he loves you, it's in his pupil dilation

science knows that self report is bad!

ordering can affect responses

paper that people can't explain their own thoughts and decisions

psychologist tactics:
fMRI, physiological measures (heart rate, pupil dilation, etc), NLP, social media posts, politician's speeches, eye contact

reverse inference problem: we know the other measurements mean something only from self report. what if they match? so what? what if they DON'T match?

No way around the problem. sometimes will use indirect measures like measuring an action. they may not be complete pictures, but they are complementary to each other. divergence is an opportunity to gain insight

# lies about lying

reasons wary of self report: being lied to from social desirability, demand characteristics, expressive responding, partisan cheerleading (people exaggerating responses to make a point)

people lie less than you think

betrayal aversion: taking worse odds to avoid possibility of being duped

article claims that it's more likely that it's imprecise rather than lies

asterisk is that people will still ly.

 The fact that you can dump some questions into a Google Form doesn’t mean you’ve mastered the art of probing the human mind. 

takes a long time to develop the right question; ie are you getting what you really ant?

how you word the question matters!

While physiological measures, reaction times, eye tracking, and the like might be useful for triangulating the truth, they are not a back door into the mind. If you say otherwise, well, perhaps I shouldn’t believe you until you complete an IAT, climb into an fMRI tube, and strap a plethysmograph onto your privates. Only then will I know what you really think.
