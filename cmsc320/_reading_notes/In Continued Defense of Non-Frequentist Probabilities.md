[In Continued Defense of Non-Frequentist Probabilities](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/in-continued-defense-of-non-frequentist)
The article argues in favor of using probabilities to describe uncertain, non-repeating, and hard-to-model events, such as political outcomes, technological advancements, or existential risks like AI-driven catastrophes. It defends the use of non-frequentist probabilities (i.e., probabilities that are not based on repeated trials or well-defined distributions) as a practical and linguistically useful tool for communicating uncertainty and making informed decisions. The key points of the argument are:

Linguistic Convenience: Probabilities provide a clearer and more precise way to communicate uncertainty compared to vague terms like "likely" or "unlikely." Using percentages allows for more nuanced expression and reduces ambiguity in communication.

Probabilities as Descriptions of Outcomes, Not Information: Probabilities describe the balance between possible outcomes, not the amount of information or certainty behind them. Even in cases of limited knowledge, assigning probabilities can still be meaningful and useful.

Social and Practical Value: Well-calibrated probabilities, such as those provided by expert forecasters, have practical value in decision-making. They help individuals and organizations make better-informed choices, even in complex and uncertain domains.

Probabilities as Outputs of Reasoning: Assigning probabilities is not a substitute for reasoning but rather the result of a reasoning process, whether formal or informal. Probabilities can reflect the synthesis of evidence, models, and expert judgment.

Applicability to Complex Domains: Even in poorly understood domains like AI risk, probabilities can still be useful for expressing degrees of belief and uncertainty. While these probabilities may be more speculative, they are still better than vague language for conveying informed opinions.

The article ultimately rejects metaphysical objections to using probabilities for non-repeating events, arguing that such objections hinder clear communication and decision-making. It advocates for embracing probabilities as a practical tool for navigating uncertainty, even in domains where traditional frequentist approaches do not apply.
