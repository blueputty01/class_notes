## Zero-Inflated Poisson Distribution

- Oftentimes, poisson distributions can have a spike at zero.
- Any distribution can be zero inflated
- You will need to deal with these differently

# central limit theorem 

means that if we sample a distribution a bunch of times, the set of samples means is normally distributed

# summary statistics

summary statistics are for after you understand your data holistically

measures of central tendency will tell you about the center of your distribution. these include: 

- pythagorean means 
	- arithmetic mean
	- geometric mean
	- harmonic mean
- median
- mode

***

The **geometric mean** is a measure of central tendency less sensitive to outliers
> harmonic mean is primarily used for rates
> $\sqrt[n]{|x_1| \cdot |x_2| \cdots |x_n|}$

**Modality** is a count of how many peaks there are.

***

A **zero-inflated** model is a model with **frequent zero-valued observations**.

***

The geometric mean is **between** the mean and median.
