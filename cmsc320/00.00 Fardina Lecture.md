3 V's (components) of big data: **volume**, **1::velocity**, **1::variety**

---

volume: vast amount of data generated or collected; this has increased exponentially

velocity: represents speed at which data is generated

---

The data lifecycle:
Data **collection**
Data **1::processing**
**1::EDA (Exploratory analysis and data viz)**
