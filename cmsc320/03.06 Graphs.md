# Vocab

Temporal graphs (also known as dynamic, evolving, or time-varying graphs) can be informally described as graphs that **change with time**.

The adjacency matrix does not work to featurize graphs for traditional machine learning because each **graph can have many different ones**.

Network embeddings can be done with small graphlets, small connected non-isomorphic induced **subgraphs of a large network**.

The **diameter** of a graph is the **maximum shortest path length between any two vertices in the graph**.

**Persistence** in temporal graphs refers to the **duration or time span** for which a particular graph element (edge or vertex) remains unchanged.

The **in-degree** of a vertex is the **number of incoming edges** to that vertex in a directed graph.

The **out-degree** of a vertex is the **number of outgoing edges** from that vertex in a directed graph.

**Degree centrality** measures the importance of a node based on its **number of connections**, where higher degree indicates greater centrality.

**Closeness centrality** quantifies how **close a node is to all other nodes** in the network, typically calculated as the inverse of the average shortest path distance.

**Eigenvector centrality** assigns relative scores to nodes based on the principle that **connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more** to the score than connections to low-scoring nodes.

**Betweenness centrality** measures how often **a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes** in the network. Nodes with high betweenness centrality control the **flow of information** in the graph.

# Link Prediction

Link prediction:
Local similarity based measures:
- Common neighbors
- **Jaccard** index 
- **1::Adamic-Adar** coefficient
- Number of length 3 paths between them
> want to predict when a link forms in a graph
> want to measure how unexpected a link is

The **Jaccard coefficient** measures similarity between two nodes based on their **common neighbors**. It is calculated as the ratio of the **intersection** of their neighbor sets to the **union** of their neighbor sets.
> $J(A,B)=\frac{|A\cap B|}{|A\cup B|}$

The **Adamic–Adar index** predicts links between nodes by weighting common neighbors inversely by their degree, giving more importance to **rare connections**. 
> Nodes sharing many low-degree neighbors have a higher score.
> $A(x,y)=\sum_{u\in N(x)\cap N(y)}\frac{1}{\log|N(u)|}$

# Community Detection

An edge is a **bridge** if its removal results in disconnection of its terminal vertices.
+
In real world networks, strict bridges are rare, so a shortcut bridge relaxes this definition by removing an edge if doing so **increases the shortest path distance between two endpoint nodes**
> the longer the distance, the weaker the tie
> [cmsc320\_f2021\_lec09.pdf](https://cmsc320.github.io/lecs/cmsc320_f2021_lec09.pdf)

A **community** is where the removal of a bridge separates the graph into disjoint components. 

Girvan-Newman Method:
- Remove the edges of **highest betweenness** first.
- Repeat the same step with the remainder graph.
- Continue this until the graph breaks down into individual nodes.
As the graph breaks down into pieces, the tightly knit **community** structure is
exposed.
> Results in a hierarchical partitioning of the graph

# Node Embeddings

Node2Vec uses **random walks** to generate vector embeddings for nodes in a graph. It introduces two key parameters:
- `p` (the **return parameter**) controls the likelihood of **2::immediately revisiting** the previous node.
- `q` (the **2::in-out parameter**) determines whether the walk explores **2::locally** (BFS-like) or **2::globally** (DFS-like).
+
Setting `p` and `q` to favor **BFS-like exploration** produces **structural-equivalent embeddings**, where nodes with similar network roles are close in the embedding space.

Network **homophily** is the tendency of nodes to connect to others of the same type.

Preferred modern way of embedding graph/node/link: graph **neural networks**.
