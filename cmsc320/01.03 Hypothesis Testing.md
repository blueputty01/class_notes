- z-test: A test we can use if your data is normally distributed and we have a large number of samples
- t-test: A test we can use if your data is normally distributed and we have a small number of samples
- Paired tests: Used when we follow specific population members **through time**

***

If data is normally distributed, use a **parametric** test, otherwise use a non-**1::parametric**.

The preferred method after performing multiple hypothesis tests is the **Bonferroni correction**
	cut down the number of p tests that you are willing to accept

***

A **chi-squared** test compares count data in different groups to their expected counts within each group.

The _Bonferroni test_ is a multiple-comparison correction used when several dependent or independent statistical tests are being performed simultaneously. 
The reason is that while a given alpha value may be appropriate for each individual comparison, it is not appropriate **for the set of all comparisons**.
> adjust for multiple comparisons
