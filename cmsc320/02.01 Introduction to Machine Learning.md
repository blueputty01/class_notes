A model is a mathematical object that takes data where the label is **unknown** and **1::assigns it a label**.

A **weighted KNN** model is a model that assigns a label to a data point by taking a weighted average of the labels of the k-nearest neighbors of that data point.
	$y=\sum_{k\in K}\frac{1}{dist(k,p)}*k_{label}$

	must be able to store the entire training set (peto-bytes or exo-bytes)
	$K$ must be tuned correctly

In a weighted KNN model, searching for nearest neighbors is time consuming (this can be helped by **spherical** approach through a K-D tree)

In the KNN model, if $K=N$, we will predict the **mode of the data**.

KNN is a(n) **instance based** model meaning it requires all the training data be stored to work.

A **hyperparameter** is an argument to the model that determines how the model behaves.
	eg $K$ in an **KNN** model
