1. We want to first translate the matrix to be aligned at the origin by applying the translation matrix with parameters (1, -2). Then we apply rotation matrix with $\pi/6$. Finally we translate the matrix back by applying the $T$ matrix with parameters $(-1, 2)$
2. Translate the matrix by $(1, -2)$, then rotate by $\pi/4$. 
3. We must find the angle of rotation. To do this, we look at the relation $\tan{\theta} = \frac{y}{x}$ and compare it to the given line $y=\sqrt{3}x$. Thus $\theta = \tan^{-1}{\sqrt{3}}$. Then we rotate by $-\theta$ , apply the reflection, then rotate back.
4. We must shift the matrix down to align the eyes with the $x$ axis. This is done with $T(0, -2)$. Then we apply the $x$ axis reflection matrix. We guess $[0, 10]$ to be a range where the graph fits and verify this is true.
5. $c \approx 1.33$
6. Isolate the eyes (first two rows). Then reorder the matrix such that it's ordered by the first row in increasing order.  
7. Perform an action similar to 4.
