The matrix key identity:
**$p(D)e^{tA}=p(A)e^{tA}$**
+
Therefore each entry of $e^{tA}$ satisfies 

A polynomial $p(z)$ **annihilates** a square matrix $A$ if $p(A)=0$
> The Cayley-Hamilton Theorem says that every square matrix is annihilated by its so-called characteristic polynomial.

The characteristic polynomial of an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ is **$p_{A}(z)=\det(zI-A)$**
For a $2 \times 2$ matrix, $p_{\mathbf{A}}(z)=**z^2-\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A})z+\det(\mathbf{A})**$
> The Cayley-Hamilton Theorem says that every square matrix is annihilated by its so-called characteristic polynomial.

Cayley - Hamilton theorem:
**For every $n\times n$ matrix, $p_A (A) = 0$**
> we will not treat the general case (non $2 \times 2$) in this course

To compute $e^{tA}$ for an $m \times m$ matrix $A$:
1. **1::Compute the characteristic polynomial $p_A(z)$ of degree $m$**
2. **1::Compute a natural fundamental set of solutions for $p_A(0)y=0$, $t_I = 0$, say $N_0(t),\ldots,N_{m-1}(t)$**
3. **1::Then compute $e^{tA}=N_0(t)Id+N_1(t)A+\cdots+N_{m-1}(t)A^{m-1}$ to fit the initial conditions**
> the notes say that we will focus on other methods however

Eigenvalues are detected through the **characteristic polynomial**.

The **eigenvalues** of $A$ are the roots of **$p_A(z)$**.
