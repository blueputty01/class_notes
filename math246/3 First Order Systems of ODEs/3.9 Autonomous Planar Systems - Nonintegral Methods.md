Taylor approximation suggests that near $(x_0, y_0)$ our system behaves like
$\frac{d}{dt}\left(\begin{matrix}{\tilde{x}}\\{\tilde{y}}\end{matrix}\right)=\partial\bar{f}\left(x_{0},y_{0}\right)\left(\begin{matrix}{\tilde{x}}\\{\tilde{y}}\end{matrix}\right)$
Where $\partial\bar{f}(x_0,y_0)$ is the **Jacobian matrix** $af(x_{0},y_{0})=\begin{pmatrix}\partial xf(x_{0},y_{0})&\partial yf(x_{0},y_{0})\\\partial xg(x_{0},y_{0})&\partial yg(x_{0},y_{0})\end{pmatrix}$

**Conservative** systems can only exhibit **centers** or **2::saddles** near stationary points.
> this can be used to show that a system is not conservative

A stationary point is called **stable** if **every solution that starts sufficiently near it stays arbitrarily close to it**.
> unstable if it is not stable.

A stationary point is called **attracting** if **every solution that starts near it approaches it as $t \to + \infty$**.
> repelling if every point moves away

Attracting/repelling implies **stable/unstable** respectively but not the converse

It **origin** is attracting or repelling for linearized system, then the stationary point exhibits the same behavior for original system.

If system is **conservative** and origin is a center of linearized system then stationary point is stable for original system.

If $\partial\bar{f}(x_0,y_0)$ has **positive** eigenvalue, the $(x_0, y_0)$ stationary is **unstable**.
