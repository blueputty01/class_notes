Considering homogeneous linear systems of the form $d_{dt}\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} =A\begin{pmatrix}x \\ y\end{pmatrix}$
where $A=\left(\begin{array}{cc}a_{11}&a_{12}\\a_{21}&a_{22}\end{array}\right)$, a constant matrix with real coefficients.
Such a system is **planar**
> Solutions $(x(t),y(t))$ trace a curve on the plane, but we want to know how they behave qualitatively

**2::contracting** if **1::$\lambda < 0$** **2::(![|50](z_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250508173409.png))**
**2::stationary** if **1::$\lambda = 0$** **2::(![|50](z_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250508173413.png))**

There are three main types of orbits of a system according to the eigenvalues of A:
- **1::two real eigenvalues**
- **1::a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues**
- **1::one eigenvalue**

- Suppose $A$ has two real eigenvalues $\lambda_1 < \lambda_2$
- Let $(\lambda_1,\mathbf{v}_1)$, $(\lambda_2,\mathbf{v}_2)$ be two real eigenpairs of $A$
Then analyze the general solution $x(t)=c_{1}e^{\lambda_{1}t}\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}e^{\lambda_{2}t}\mathbf{v}_{2}$

Phase portrait:
If $a_{21} =0$, we cannot decide between clockwise/counterclockwise. 
Thus **use $a_{12}$**
If $a_{12} **1::>** 0$, it is **1::clockwise** and vice versa
