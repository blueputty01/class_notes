Explicit first-order ODEs have the form **$y' = f(t)$**
> solving the explicit DE is easy as finding an antiderivative for $f(t)$

A **general** solution to a DE is a solution involving constants and for which different constants will give all solutions.
> A specific or particular solution is a solution in which a specific (particular) choice of constant(s) has been made.

A **specific** or **1::particular** solution is a solution in which a specific (particular) choice of constant(s) has been made.
> A general solution to a DE is a solution involving constants and for which different constants will give all solutions.

An initial condition of the form **$y(t_I) = y_I$** defines the **initial value** $y_I$. Together, they form an initial value problem (IVP).

In words, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that if a function is **continuous** on an open interval, then it has a(n) **1::antiderivative** on that open interval

The **interval of existence** is **the largest open interval containing $t_I$ on which a solution exists**
