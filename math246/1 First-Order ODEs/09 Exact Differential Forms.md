A differential equation is **exact** if it has the form **$H_x(x,y)+H_y(x,y)\frac{dy}{dx}=0$**

$\frac{d}{d x}H(x,y)=**\ H_{x}(x,y)+ H_{y}(x,y)\frac{d y}{d x}**$

***

If the DE has the form $M+N{\frac{d y}{d x}}=0$, then it is exact if and only if **$M_y= N_x$**
	Trick to detecting whether a differential equation is exact

***

To find integrating factor, solve the form: **$[M f(x)]_x = [N f(y)]_y$**
> can also use $f(y)$
