### can x^3 by the solution to a differential equation of the form w'' + aw' + bw = 0, where a and b are real constants?

answer: it cannot be because the coefficients are not equal to 0 for all x

Why Must It Hold for All xx?

The differential equation describes a relationship that must hold **globally** (i.e., everywhere in the domain), not just at specific points. Here’s why:

- **Physical Interpretation**: In many applications, differential equations model physical systems (e.g., motion, heat flow, population dynamics). The equation represents a fundamental law or principle that governs the system **at all times and locations**. A solution must satisfy this law everywhere, not just at isolated points.
    
- **Mathematical Consistency**: A differential equation defines a relationship between a function and its derivatives. If the equation only holds at specific points, the function and its derivatives would not be consistently related across the entire domain, violating the definition of a solution.
    
- **Uniqueness of Solutions**: Differential equations often have unique solutions (under certain conditions). If the equation only holds at specific points, there could be infinitely many functions that satisfy the equation at those points, making it impossible to determine a unique solution.

he author invokes the **uniqueness theorem** for solutions to linear differential equations. This theorem states that if the coefficients of the differential equation (in this case, aa and bb) are continuous (which they are, since they are constants), then the solution to the differential equation is **unique** for a given set of initial conditions.

Since both f(x)f(x) and g(x)g(x) satisfy the same initial conditions at x=0x=0, and g(x)=0g(x)=0 is already a solution to the differential equation, the uniqueness theorem implies that g(x)=0g(x)=0 is the **only** solution with these initial conditions. This "crowds out" f(x)=x3f(x)=x3, meaning f(x)f(x) cannot also be a solution.
