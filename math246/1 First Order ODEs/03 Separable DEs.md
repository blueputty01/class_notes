A DE is **separable** if it can be written in the form **$y ′ = f(t)g(y)$**.
	The word separable comes from the fact that the right side is separated into a product of a function of $t$ and a function of $y$

Integral-form solution for $y' = f(t) g(y)$: 
**$\int{\frac{1}{g(y)}}d y=\int f(t)d t$**
> $\frac{d y}{d t}=f(t)g(y)$
> ${\frac{1}{g(y)}}d y=f(t)d t$
> $\int{\frac{1}{g(y)}}d y=\int f(t)d t$
> don't forget to check the case where g(y) = 0; eg constant functions which are additional solutions to the separable DE

When solving separable equations $y ′ = f(t)g(y)$, the functions arising from when **$g(y) = 0$** are valid **constant solutions** and must be added to the solution set.

An **implicit** solution is a solution where we have not achieved the **1::explicit** $y=$ solution.

**Autonomous** ODEs occur when **$f(t) = 1$**
	so we have $y' = g(y)$

Always check if **constant** solutions satisfy the IV
