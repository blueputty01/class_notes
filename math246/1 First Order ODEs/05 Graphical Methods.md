If there is different behavior on each side then the constant solution is **semistable**.

If nearby solutions move away from the constant solution on both sides then the constant solution is **unstable**.

If nearby solutions move toward the constant solution on both sides then the constant solution is **stable**.

The number line showing information about whether the solutions are increasing or decreasing is the **phase line portrait** of the autonomous differential equation.

When picking various values of C in the implicit solution, the resultant plot is called the **contour plot**.
What’s useful about these contour plots is that the parts of the curves that form functions are explicit solutions to the DE because they’re functions (y in terms of t) that satisfy the implicit solution. This means that we can pick a point on a curve and follow it as far left and right as possible and the result is the graph of an explicit solution to the DE.

Parts of contour plot curves that form **functions** are explicit solutions to the differential equation because they're functions that satisfy the implicit solution.
