A differential equation is an algebraic relation that involves some or all of:
- an unknown function of one or more variables such as $y(t)$
- derivatives of that function such as $y'$, $y''$, and so on
- **other functions of the same variable(s) such as $\sin(t)$ and $t^2$**

A(n) **ordinary** differential equation is a **differential equation involving derivatives with respect to only one variable**.

A(n) **partial** differential equation is a **differential equation involving derivatives with respect to multiple variables**.

A DE is **linear** if it can be written as a sum of some or all of:
- **An unknown $f$ multiplied by a coefficient**
- **2::derivatives of the unknown $f$ multiplied by coefficients**
- **2::coefficients**
	coefficients mean that they can be other functions of the same variable that $f$ is, including just constants, including 0
	Example: The DE $(\tan t)y(t) âˆ’ t 3y ' (t) + 7y ''(t) = 1$ is linear.

The **order** of a differential equation is **the highest derivative that appears in it**.
	Example: $x^7 f'(x) + (\cos x)f(x) + x = e^x$ is first-order.

The order of a system of DEs is **the highest derivative that appears in any of the DEs**.
