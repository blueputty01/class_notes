Definition:
$\int_{b}^{a}f=-\int_{a}^{b}f$
So that $0=\int_{a}^{a}f=**\int_{a}^{b}f+\int_{b}^{a}f**$

**Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus::Theorem Name**
Let $f\in C[a,b]$. Then:
- $\frac{d}{dx}\int_{a}^{x}f(t)dt=**f(x)**$
- $\frac{d} {dx}\int_{a}^{h(x)}f(t)=**f(h(x))h(x)**$
+
Proof:
Let $F(x)=\int_{a}^{x}f(t)dt$. We'll compute $\mathcal{F}^{\prime}(x_0)$.

To say that a function $f:X\to Y$ is continuous one writes $f\in C( X,Y)$, which reads " f is in the set of continuous mappings from X to Y". 

If a function  $f:X\to Y$ is continuously differentiable, one writes $f\in C^{1} (X,Y)$ 

If it is $k$ times differentiable and that $k$-th derivative is continuous, one writes $f \in C^{k} (X,Y)$. 

Note that the formula is still true at $x = a, x=b$ with 1 sided derivatives. But the textbook defines $\forall x \in (a,b)$
