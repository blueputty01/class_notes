These notes contain all definitions and theorems from lecture.

These notes also contain class and homework examples that I found challenging/I felt had some sort of trick to them. I would be careful using them as your instructor may have different focuses.

Notes for the anki version of these notes:
- Almost all typos have been corrected in the Anki version. I backported the worst errors; the rest of the errors in these markdown files are up to the reader to catch
- When I'm reviewing, I'm pretty handwavey. As long as I get the general idea of a theorem it's good enough.

Notes for future versions of these notes:
- standardize theorem/definition/example cards in beginning of semester
	- example cards should have source(homework, lecture, textbook)
	- theorem cards should have conditions and implications separated
	- keep proof and theorem cloze on the same card
- standardize continuous, compact notation (eg continuous, closed and bounded, continuous and compact, or $C[a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$)
