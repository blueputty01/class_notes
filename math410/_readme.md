These notes contain all definitions and theorems from lecture.

These notes also contain class and homework examples that I found challenging/I felt had some sort of trick to them. I would be careful using them as your instructor may have different focuses.

About the anki version of these notes:
- Almost all typos have been corrected in the Anki version. I backported the worst errors; the rest of the errors in these markdown files are up to the reader to catch
	- Thus some things are explained in the Anki extra field but not in these notes
- When I'm reviewing (especially for mature cards), I'm pretty hand-wavey. As long as I get the general idea of a theorem it's good enough. I think it's a waste of time to make sure every single line of the proof is properly accounted for. These should take ~15 seconds max. It's ok for new cards to take up to a minute.
- While handwritten notes, the markdown files, and the notes often have a 1-1 relationship, I sometimes have more information on the original handwritten notes and will pull them up occasionally while reviewing to clarify doubts
- I find that it's more effective to cloze an entire proof rather than cloze parts of it (like how actual clozes are supposed to work) since you must recall an entire proof all at once on an exam, not just parts of it.

Notes for future versions of these notes/cards:
- standardize theorem/definition/example cards in beginning of semester
	- example cards should have source(homework, lecture, textbook)
	- theorem cards should have conditions and implications separated
	- keep proof and theorem cloze on the same card
- standardize whether theorem hypotheses should be combined in one cloze set with the theorem result
- standardize continuous, compact notation (eg continuous, closed and bounded, continuous and compact, or $C[a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$)
