Notes for future versions of these notes
- standardize theorem/definition/example cards in beginning of semester
	- example cards should have source(homework, lecture, textbook)
	- theorem cards should have conditions and implications separated
	- keep proof and theorem cloze on the same card
- standardize continuous, compact notation (eg continuous, closed and bounded, continuous and compact, or $C[a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$)
