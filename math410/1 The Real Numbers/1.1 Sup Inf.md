The **completeness** axiom states that:
- **there are no holes in $\mathbb{R}$**
- **1::there are holes in $\mathbb{Q}$**
	$\mathbb{R}$ is also connected

A set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded if **$\exists \alpha \in \mathbb{R}^{+}$ such that $\forall x \in S$, $|x| \leq \alpha$**
- If **$\forall x, x \leq M$** then it's bounded **above**
- If **2::$\forall x, m \leq x$** then it's bounded **3::below**

**Completeness** axiom: suppose **$S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a nonempty subset, and bounded above**. Among all upper bounds $\beta$ of $S$, $\exists$ least (smallest) upper bound called a **supremum**, denoted **$\operatorname{sup}(S)$**
	eg: $(0, 1)$ $\sup({S}) = 1$, but $1 \neq \max(S)$
	since $S$ contains no maximal element
	$1 = \sup([0, 1]) = \max([0, 1])$

If $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is bounded below, the **infimum**, denoted **$\inf(S)$**, is the **greatest lower bound of $S$**
	eg $0 = \inf((0, 1))$

Theorem: If $S \in \mathbb{R}$ is bounded **below**, then $\inf{(S)}$ exists. Proof using **completeness axiom**. 
	We consider the set obtained by "reflecting" the set $S$ about the number $0$; that is, we will consider the set $T \equiv \{x \in \mathbb{R} | -x \textrm{- x is in S}\}$. For any number $x, b \leq x$ iff $-x \leq -b$. Thus a number $b$ is a lower bound for $S$ if and only if the number $-b$ is an upper bound for $T$. Since the set $S$ has been assumed to be bounded below, it follows that $T$ is bounded above. The Completeness Axiom asserts that there is a least upper bound for $T$, which we denote by $c$. Since lower bounds of $S$ occur as negatives of upper bounds for $T$, the number $-c$ is the greatest lower bound for $S$.

Theorem: Let $S$ be nonempty, and $M$ is an upper bound of $S$ (or $m$ for lower bound). Then:
i. **$M = \sup{(s)} \iff \forall \epsilon > 0 \exists x_\epsilon \in S (x_{\epsilon} > M - \epsilon)$**
ii. **$m = \inf{(s)} \iff \forall \epsilon > 0 \exists x_\epsilon \in S (x_\epsilon < m + \epsilon)$**
	just rephrasing in mathematical symbols
	note: if $\epsilon = \frac{1}{n}$, then $\exists n \in \mathbb{N} \exists x_n \in S x_n > m - \frac{1}{n}$, and we get $\{x_n\}^\inf_{n=1}$ converging to $\sup{(s)}$

$S = (0, 1) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. 
Prove that $0 = \inf{(S)}$:
+
General steps: 
i. show that  **$0$ is a lower bound**
ii. show that **1::$0$ is the largest lower bound**, ie **1::for any lower bound $\beta$ of $S$, $\beta \leq 0$**
+
To prove ii:
{{c3::
Let $\beta$ be a lower bound of $S$. For a proof by contradiction, suppose $\beta > 0$.
Case 1: $0 < \beta < 1$ 
Half of $\beta$ will be within $S$
+
Case 2: $\beta \geq 1$
$\frac{1}{2} \in S; \frac{1}{2} < \beta$
}}
