Theorem: Let $f: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be continuous with an arbitrary interval $I$. Then **$f(I)$ is an interval**.
Proof: 
**We know $\exists x_1, x_2 \in I$ such that $y_1 = f(x_1), y_2 = f(x_2)$. WLOG, suppose $x_1 \leq x_2$. By IVT, $\exists x$ between $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that $f(x) = c$ so $c \in f(I)$. Since $c$ is arbitrary, we conclude $[y_1, y_2] \subseteq f(I)$, so $f(I)$ is an interval**

> $f(I)$ is an interval, but $f$ is discontinuous 

Theorem: Let $f: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be monotone. If $f(D)$ is **an interval**, then $f$ is **continuous**.
> The proof is non-trivial and is skipped
> Note that we do not assume that $D$ is an interval. The theorem still holds for the example below

Theorem: **strictly monotone** functions are **one to one**
Proof:
**WLOG assume that $f$ is strictly increasing, so $u < v \iff f(u) < f(v)$, which immediately implies 1-1**.
> the converse is NOT true! Ie injectivity does not imply strict monotonicity

Theorem: If $f: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is **continuous** on an interval $I$, then $f$ is injective $\iff f$ is **1::strictly monotone**
> Proof skipped

Definition: If $f: D \rightarrow f(D)$ is $1-1$, then $f^{-1}: f(D) \rightarrow D$ is defined by **$f^{-1}(y) = x \iff f(x) = y$**

Theorem: Let $f: D \rightarrow f(D)$ be strictly monotone, then $f^{-1}$ is **strictly monotone**
> Proof: skip

Theorem: Let $f: I \rightarrow f(I)$ be strictly monotone, with $I$ an interval, then $f^{-1}$ is **continuous::beyond strict monotonicity**.
