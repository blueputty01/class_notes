# 1 Modern Privacy and Surveillance

public vs private

surveillance vs ?? (no exact term; "absence of surveillance") refers to normalization of surveillance

privacy is not a true opposite of surveillance

Surveillance implies an agent who accesses (whether through discovery tools, rules or physical/logistical settings) personal data. 
Privacy, in contrast, involves a subject who restricts access to personal data through the same means

Yes, privacy (or better actions taken to restrict access to all or only to insiders) may serve to nullify surveillance. Familiar examples are encryption, whispering and disguises.
2. But surveillance may serve to protect privacy. Examples include biometric identification and audit trails.
3. Privacy may serve to protect surveillance. Consider undercover police who use various fronts and false identification to protect their real identity and activities.
4. Surveillance may serve to nullify privacy (big data, night vision video cameras, drugs tests break through protective borders).

## panopticon 

bentham -> foucault (less surveillance in society)

foucault:

- panopticon is successful because it breeds self-surveillance.
- sense of self comes from the relationships between those who surveil us for knowledge and control and from measuring ourselves in relation to these metrics. ie labelling theory

is digital surveillance the same as the panopticon?

# 2  Modern Privacy and Surveillance II

Why gather more information on citizens?

Welfare: provide needed services – transportation, public health and safety, etc.
	Welfare systems provide benefits to those most in need
		Makes society function better and can maintain political stability

War: information needed on service-eligible populations; war-making industrial capabilities; intelligence; etc.
	National security

bottom up vs top down surveillance

> He suggests that such rationalization of society can be highly effective when used in liberal societies where planners had to negotiate with citizens. However, when such techniques are adopted by an authoritarian state, often alongside a fragile civil society which does not have the strength or ability to resist such structural reforms, they are much more likely to fail

> Unlike Scott’s examples of authoritarian regimes, in a democracy there is a form of social contract at work which balances increased surveillance and information collection on citizens with an expectation of state protection and paternalism. State control of information on citizens under the auspice of their welfare has long been used as a powerful justification for surveillance.
