An edge $e=\{v_1,v_2\}$ is **incident** to a vertex $v$ if $v$ is one of the endpoints of the edge.

The number of vertices of a graph, i.e. $|V(G)|$ is the **order** of the graph. 

The number of edges of the graph, i.e. $|E(G)|$ is the **size** of the graph.

A graph $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ if $V(H) \subseteq V(G)$ and $E(H) \subseteq E(G)$. If **$V(H) = V(G)$**, then $H$ is said to be a spanning subgraph of $G$.
+
We say $H$ is a vertex-**induced subgraph** of $G$ if whenever $u, v \in V(H)$ and **3::$uv \in E(G)$**, then **3::$uv \in E(H)$**.
> If $S = V(H) \subseteq V(G)$, the subgraph induced by $S$ is denoted $G[S]$.
