If a graph $G$ has size $m$ (number of edges), then $\sum_{v\in V(G)}\operatorname{deg}(v)=**2m**$
Corollary: a graph cannot have an **odd** number of vertices of odd degree.

A graph is **regular** if every vertex has the same degree.

Given graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, its degree sequence is a **non-increasing** sequence of length $n$ whose $i$th term is the degree of vertex $i$.

Theorem:
Let $d_1,\ldots d_n$ be a non-increasing sequence. Then there is a corresponding graph $G$ if and only if **$d_2-1,d_2-1,\ldots d_{d_{1+1}}-1,d_{d_{1+2}},d_{d_1+3},\ldots d_n$** is graphical.
General structure of proof in forward direction:
**Assume BWOC there is no vertex $v_1$ of degree $d_1$ that is adjacent to all vertices of the next highest degree. Thus we can take the graph where $S(G)$ is maximal and construct a graph with even higher $S(G)$ by swapping edges between the unconnected high degree and $v_1$**

---

ie remove $d_1$, subtract 1 in the sequence from the next $d_1$ terms (leave others alone)
may need the reorder the sequence in subsequent applications of this operation

The construction for a given degree sequence may not be unique.

Proof (reverse): Given $d_2-1,\ldots d_{d_1+1}-1,\ldots d_n$ is graphical, add $v_1$ of degree $d$ and attain to the vertices that were the first $d$ in the list.

Proof (forward): 
#### Stage 1: The Contradiction Hypothesis

We want to prove that **there exists** a graph where the highest-degree vertex is connected to the next $d_1$ highest-degree vertices.

The proof starts by assuming the opposite for contradiction:
> **Assumption (A):** There is *no* graph with this degree sequence that has a vertex of degree $d_1$ adjacent to *all* of the vertices with degrees $d_2, d_3, \dots, d_{d_1+1}$.

In other words, in *every* possible graph $G$ with this degree sequence, the vertex with degree $d_1$ (let's call it $v_1$) is "missing" at least one connection to these high-degree vertices and is instead connected to a vertex with a smaller degree.

#### Stage 2: Choosing an "Extremal" Graph

Since we are assuming (A) is true for all graphs, we can be picky. We choose a specific graph $G$ from all the graphs with our degree sequence. The criterion for choosing it is:
> Among all graphs with the given degree sequence, pick a graph $G$ where the vertex $v_1$ (with degree $d_1$) has the **maximum possible sum of the degrees of its neighbors**.

Let $S(G) = \text{sum of the degrees of the vertices adjacent to } v_1$.
We choose $G$ such that $S(G)$ is as large as possible.

**Why do this?** Because we are going to show that if (A) were true, we could find another graph $G'$ with the same degree sequence but with an *even larger* $S(G')$, which contradicts the maximality of our chosen $G$. This is the core of the extremal argument.

#### Stage 3: Analyzing the Chosen Graph $G$

We have our maximal graph $G$. By our initial assumption (A), $v_1$ is *not* connected to all of the high-degree vertices $v_2, \dots, v_{d_1+1}$. So there must be at least one "missed" high-degree vertex.

Let's formalize this:
*   Let the neighbors of $v_1$ be a set $N$.
*   Since (A) is true, there exists some vertex $x$ (with a high degree $d_x$) from the set $\{v_2, \dots, v_{d_1+1}\}$ that is **not** in $N$.
*   Conversely, since $v_1$ has degree $d_1$, it must be connected to *some* vertex $y$ that is **not** in the high-priority set. The degree of $y$ ($d_y$) must be less than or equal to the degree of $x$ (because the sequence is non-increasing and $x$ was in the top group that was missed). So we have $d_y \le d_x$.

Summary of the situation in $G$:
*   $v_1$ is connected to $y$, but not to $x$.
*   $x$ is a "more important" (higher-degree) vertex than $y$.

#### Stage 4: The Key Swap (The "Rewiring")

We will now modify graph $G$ to create a new graph $G'$ with the same degree sequence but a larger $S(G')$.

Consider the vertices $x$ and $y$.
*   $v_1$ is adjacent to $y$ but not to $x$.

Now, what about the connection between $x$ and $y$? There are two cases:

1.  **If $x$ is not adjacent to $y$:** Then we can simply "rewire" the connection. Delete the edge $(v_1, y)$ and add the edge $(v_1, x)$. Now $v_1$ is connected to the higher-degree vertex $x$ instead of $y$. The degrees of all vertices remain the same, but $S(G')$ has increased because we added $d_x$ and removed $d_y$, and $d_x > d_y$. This directly contradicts the maximality of $S(G)$.

2.  **If $x$ is adjacent to $y$:** Then we need a more clever rewiring because simply adding $(v_1, x)$ would create a double edge. Since $x$ has a high degree and $y$ has a lower degree, and $x$ is not connected to $v_1$, there must be some other vertex $z$ such that:
    *   $x$ is connected to $z$, but
    *   $y$ is **not** connected to $z$.

    **Why must such a $z$ exist?** Think about the neighbors of $x$ and $y$. Vertex $x$ has more neighbors (higher degree) than $y$. It's impossible for the neighbors of $y$ to be a superset of the neighbors of $x$ (other than $y$ itself not being a neighbor of $x$, and $v_1$ being a neighbor of $y$ but not $x$). There must be at least one "extra" neighbor of $x$ that $y$ does not have.

    Now, perform the **double swap**:
    *   Remove edges $(v_1, y)$ and $(x, z)$.
    *   Add edges $(v_1, x)$ and $(y, z)$.

Let's check the degree sequence after this swap:
*   $v_1$: Lost connection to $y$, gained connection to $x$. Degree unchanged.
*   $x$: Lost connection to $z$, gained connection to $v_1$. Degree unchanged.
*   $y$: Lost connection to $v_1$, gained connection to $z$. Degree unchanged.
*   $z$: Lost connection to $x$, gained connection to $y$. Degree unchanged.

The degree sequence is preserved! But what happened to $S(G')$, the sum of the degrees of $v_1$'s neighbors?
*   In $G$, $v_1$'s neighbors included $y$ (contributing $d_y$) but not $x$.
*   In $G'$, $v_1$'s neighbors include $x$ (contributing $d_x$) but not $y$.

Since $d_x > d_y$, we have $S(G') > S(G)$. Again, this contradicts the maximality of our originally chosen graph $G$.

### Stage 5: The Conclusion

In both possible cases, the assumption that no "ideal" graph exists (Assumption A) leads us to construct a new graph with a larger $S(G')$. This contradicts the fact that we started with a graph $G$ that had the **maximum possible** $S(G)$.

Therefore, our initial assumption (A) must be false. **There must exist at least one graph with the degree sequence where the highest-degree vertex $v_1$ is connected to the next $d_1$ highest-degree vertices.**

Once we have such a graph, we can simply delete $v_1$ and its edges, and the remaining graph has the reduced degree sequence $(d_2 - 1, \dots, d_{d_1+1} - 1, d_{d_1+2}, \dots, d_n)$, proving it is graphical.

This completes the proof of the forward direction. The elegance of this extremal argument is that it doesn't need to construct the ideal graph directly; it just proves that it must exist.
