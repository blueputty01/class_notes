Let $n \geq k$ be positive integers.
Definition: The **$k^\textrm{th}$ falling factorial of $n$** is $(n)_{k}=**n(n-1)\ldots(n-k+1)**$

When counting, **or** indicates **addition** is the likely operation to combine cases.

When counting, **and** indicates **multiplication** is the likely operation to combine cases.

There are 5 cats, 5 dogs, and 4 mice. Count the total number of ways at least one cat can appear among 3 selected animals.
It is *incorrect* to first select a cat ($\binom{5}{1}$) and then select $2$ of the other animals ($\binom{13}{2}$) ($\binom{5}{1}\binom{13}{2}$) because **we overcount slightly since we may select cat A in $\binom{5}{1}$ but select cat A again in $\binom{13}{2}$**
> valid solution: $\binom{5}{1}\binom{9}{2} + \binom{5}{2}\binom{9}{1} + \binom{5}{3}\binom{9}{0}$ (naive summation)
> valid solution: $\binom{14}{3} - \binom{9}{3}$ (all ways to select three animals - number of ways to select no cats)

Pascal's identity for $\binom{n}{k} = **\binom{n- 1}{k - 1} + \binom{n-1}{k}**$
	number of cases for when first is chosen (so k-1 number of objects to choose) + number of cases for when first is not chosen (k objects to choose)

Number of subset identity: $**2^n** = \sum^n_{k = 0} \binom{n}{k}$
	done by setting x, y = 1 in binomial theorem $(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}x^{n-k}y^k = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}x^{k}y^{n-k}$
