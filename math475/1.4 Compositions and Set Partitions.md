Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots a_k$ be non negative integers such that $\sum_{i=1}^k a_i = n$. 
Then the ordered k-tuple $(a_1, \ldots a_k)$ is a **weak composition** of $n$ into $k$ parts.

Theorem (Stars and Bars): 
The number of weak compositions of $n$ into $k$ parts is **$\binom{n + k - 1}{ k -1}$**.

Proof: 
Let the $n$ elements be stars. We model a weak composition as follows: we draw $k$ bars, and the total stars to the right of bar $i$ (before bar $i + 1$) is the value of $a_i$.
Bar 1 is fixed in the first position. We choose the location of the remaining $k - 1$ bars, and this uniquely determines a weak composition. Thus there are $\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}$ ways.

Example: Give $n$ dollars to $k$ people. Note $1 + 4 + 5 = 5 + 4 + 1$ are different cases. 

Example: Suppose there are 10 cans of Coke, 10 cans of Pepsi, 10 cans of Sprite. How many ways can you take 4 sodas?

Solution: We want $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 4$ ($n = 4, k=3$). Total ways is $\binom{4 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1}$

Example: What about if each $x_i$ must be at least 1?

Solution: We first give each $x_i$ a value of $1$ (eg give each person $1), then do weak compositions of $n- k$ into $k$ parts. 

Corollary: The total number of k-tuples ($a_1, a_2, \ldots a_k$) such that $\sum_{i=1}^k a_i = n$ with each $a_i$ being a positive integer is $\binom{(n - k) + k - 1}{k - 1} = \binom{n-1}{k-1}$, called the total
