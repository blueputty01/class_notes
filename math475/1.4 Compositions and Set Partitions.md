Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots a_k$ be non negative integers such that $\sum_{i=1}^k a_i = n$. 
Then the ordered k-tuple $(a_1, \ldots a_k)$ is a **weak composition** of $n$ into $k$ parts.

Theorem (Stars and Bars): 
The number of weak compositions of $n$ into $k$ parts is **$\binom{n + k - 1}{ k -1}$**. 
Proof: 
Let the $n$ elements be stars. We model a weak composition as follows: we draw $k$ bars, and the total stars to the right of bar $i$ (before bar $i + 1$) is the value of $a_i$.
Bar 1 is fixed in the first position. We choose the location of the remaining $k - 1$ bars, and this uniquely determines a weak composition. Thus there are $\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}$ ways.

Example: Give $n$ dollars to $k$ people. Note $1 + 4 + 5 = 5 + 4 + 1$ are different cases.
