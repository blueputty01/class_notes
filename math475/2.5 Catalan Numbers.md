Combinatorial proof for Catalan numbers: 
![|200](z_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020251025180956.png)
Any path we do not want will touch the bad diagonal. Suppose the first time we hit the bad diagonal is at $(i , i+ 1)$. To reach $(n, n)$, we must take another $n - i$ rights and $n - (i  +1) = n - i - 1$ ups. In the bad path, we alter the paths at the bad diagonal by reflecting in on that bad diagonal; 
ie every right is up, 
every up is right.
Now the new path yields a total of $i+(n-i-1)=n-1$ rights and $i+1+(n-i)=n+1$ ups.
The altered path thus ends at $(n - 1, n + 1)$. These paths all correspond to a path that must hit the bad diagonal; ie there must be a bijection between the paths to $(n - 1, n + 1)$ to any bad path to $(n, n)$.
Total paths go from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$ that never go above the diagonal is:
**$\left(\binom{2n}n\right)-\left(\binom{(n-1)+(n+1)}{n-1}\right)$$=\left(\begin{matrix}2n\\n\end{matrix}\right)-\left(\begin{matrix}2n\\n-1\end{matrix}\right)$ (all paths - bad paths)**, which yields the $n$th Catalan number $\frac{(2n)}{n+1}$.
