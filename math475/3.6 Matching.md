A **matching** of graph $G$ is a **set of edges with no shared endpoints**. The vertices incident to edges in a matching are **saturated (otherwise, unsaturated)**. 

A **perfect matching** is a matching that saturates every vertex in the graph.

The **size** of a matching is the number of edges in the matching.

A matching is **maximum** if there is no matching of larger size.
> The size of a matching is the number of edges in the matching.

A matching is **maximal** if no edges can be added to it without violating the matching property.
> The size of a matching is the number of edges in the matching.

Let $V$ be a vertex of $G$. The **neighborhood** of $V$ is the set of vertices adjacent to $V$. 
Now, if $G$ is bipartite with partite sets $X$ and $Y$, if $S \subseteq X$, then the neighborhood of $S$ denoted $N(S)$ is **the union of neighborhoods of each vertex in $S$**.

Hall's Marriage Theorem:
**Let $A, B$ be partite sets, $|A|=r,|B|=s,1\leq r\leq s.$ Then the graph has a matching that saturates $A$ if and only if $|N(S)|\geq|S|$ for all subsets of $A$.**

Proof (forward direction):
Given a matching that saturates $A$, each vertex in $A$ has at least 1 distinct neighbor. Thus, clearly, $|N(S)|\geq|S|$ for any $S \subseteq A$.
+
Proof (reverse direction):
Assume no matching saturates $A$. We show the existence of $S \subseteq A$ such that $|N(S)| < |S|$ (proof by contrapositive).
Let $M$ be a maximum matching and assume $u$ is an unsaturated vertex in $A$. Let $Z$ be the subset of vertices reachable from $u$ by alternating paths (paths that alternate between edges in $M$ and edges not in $M$).
We claim every vertex in $Z \backslash \{u\}$ must be incident to an edge in $M$. If the longest path ended at a vertex $v$ in $B$ (since we're alternating and the graph is bipartite) not incident to an edge in $M$, then we could augment the matching by switching the edges along the path, contradicting the maximality of $M$.
+
Now, let $A^{\prime} = A \cap Z$, and similarly $B^\prime = B \cap Z$. It follows that $|A^\prime | \geq |B^\prime| + 1$.
We now show that $|B^{\prime}|=|N(A^{\prime})|$. Let $b \in B'$. Since there is an alternating path $u \to b$, there is an edge from some $a \in A'$ to $b$, so $b \in N(A')$. Thus, $B' \subseteq N(A')$.
Now, let $c \in N(A')$. Then $c \sim a$ for some $a \in A'$. Since $a \in A'$, there is an alternating path from $u$ to $a$. Appending the edge $a \to c$ to this path gives an alternating path from $u$ to $c$, so $c \in B'$. Thus, $N(A') \subseteq B'$. Therefore, $N(A') = B'$.
+
We also have $|A'| \geq |B'| + 1$, so $|N(A')| = |B'| \leq |A'| - 1 < |A'|$. Thus, we have found a subset $S = A'$ such that $|N(S)| < |S|$.

Let $A_1, A_2, \cdots A_n$ be sets (not necessarily distinct). The collection of sets has a **system of distinct representations (SDR)** if **there exists $n$ distinct elements $a_1\ldots a_n$ such that $a_i\in A_i,\quad1\leq i\leq n$**.
