$n$ balls to $k$ bins:
1. Labeled balls to labeled bins
	1. No restriction: $(k)(k)\ldots(k) = k^n$ ways
	2. At least one: $S(n, k)k!$ ways
	3. At most one: if $n > k$, zero ways. if $k \geq n$, then $(k)(k-1)\ldots(k-n+1)=(k)_n$
2. Unlabeled balls to labeled bins
	1. No restriction: weak composition; $\binom{n + k - 1}{k-1}$ ways
	2. At least one: compositions: $\binom{n - 1}{k -1}$ ways
	3. At most one: if $n > k$, zero ways. if $k \geq n$, then $\binom{k}{n}$, then we choose which $n$ bins of the $k$ have a ball, in $\binom{k}{n}$ ways
3. Labeled balls to unlabeled bins
	1. No restriction: Could be any number of bins in use, so this is tough. These are set partitions; $\sum^k_{i=1} S(n, i)$ (not the Bell number)
	2. At least one: this is $S(n, k)$
	3. At most one: if $n > k$, zero ways. if $k \geq n$, then $\{\{1\}, \{2\}, \ldots \{n\}\}$ is the only set partition. (one way)
4. Unlabeled balls to unlabeled bins
	1. No restriction: integer partition; $\sum^k_{i=1}P_i(n)$ ways (NOT $p(n)$)
	2. At least one: $P_k(n)$ ways
	3. At most one: if $n > k$, zero ways. if $k \geq n$, then there is exactly one way: $1 + 1 + \ldots + 1 = n$
