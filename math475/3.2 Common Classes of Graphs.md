A graph $G$ is **bipartite** if $V(G)$ can be partitioned into 2 subsets $A$ and $B$, called partite sets, such that every edge of $G$ has one endpoint in $A$ and the other in $B$.
A bipartite graph with bipartite sets $A$ and $B$ is a **complete bipartite graph (biclique)** if every vertex in $A$ is adjacent to every vertex in $B$. 
> This graph may be denoted by $K_{a, b}$ where $a, b$ are the respective cardinalities of $A$ and $B$.
