Definition: 
A partition of integer $n$ is **a positive sequence of integers $a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \ldots \geq a_k$ such that $a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_k = n$**. The total partitions of integer $n$ is denoted as $p(n)$.
By convention, $P(0) = 1$
> note that $1 + 3 = 3+1$ is the same case
> $2 + 2 + 2$ is not $3!$ ways
> Ex: $n=4 \implies 3 + n = 2 + 2 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 +1 = 4$ (note that the $4$ counts as a case)
> So $p(4) =5$
> man.. $p(n)=\frac1{\pi\sqrt{2}}\sum_{k=1}^\infty A_k(n)\sqrt{k}\cdot\frac d{dn}\left(\frac1{\sqrt{n-\frac1{24}}}\sinh\biggl[\frac\pi k\sqrt{\frac23\left(n-\frac1{24}\right)}\biggr]\right)$

Definition:
A Ferrers/Young diagram of a partition $a_1 \geq \ldots a_k$ is a partial rectangular grid whose $i^\textrm{th}$ row contains $a_i$ dots/rectangles

The **conjugate** of a partition in a diagram is the diagram created by transforming row $i$ into column $i$

Theorem: 
Let $P_1$ be the total number of partitions of $n$ such that $a_1 = a_2 \geq a_3 \geq \ldots \geq a_k$. Let $P_2$ denote the total partitions of $n$ where the smallest part is at least $2$. Then $P_1 = P_2$.

Proof:
**Given a partition with $a_1 = a_2$, the conjugate partition then has the first 2 columns of the same length. Thus the smallest value (bottom row) of this partition has size at least 2, corresponding to a partition whose smallest part is at least 2. This establishes a bijection between these two types of partitions.**

Definition:
Let $P_k(n)$ denote **the total number of partitions of integer $n$ into exactly $k$ parts (NO zeros)**.

Theorem:
For $n > k > 1$, we have $P_k(n) = P_{k-1}(n-1) + P_k(n-k)$
+
Proof:
LHS: 
Total number of ways to partition $n$ into exactly $k$ parts.
RHS: 
We look at **partitions $a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \ldots \geq a_k$ such that $a_k = 1$ or $a_k > 1$ (no part size 1)**.
**If there is a part of size 1, we partition the integer $n - 1$ into exactly $k - 1$ parts in $P_{k-1}(n-1)$ ways.**
**To create a partition of $n$ so that $a_k > 1$, we first give 1 to each part. We then partition the remaining $n - k$ into exactly $k$ parts. Since each part is a positive integer, each part now has size at least 2. This can be done in exactly $P_k (n-k)$ ways.**
