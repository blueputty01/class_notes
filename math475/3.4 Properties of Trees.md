A graph is **acyclic** if it contains no cycles.

A leaf is a vertex **of degree 1**

A forest is **a(n) acyclic graph (union of trees)**

A tree is **an acyclic, connected graph**

Theorem:
A tree on 2 or more vertices has at least **2** leaves
Proof:
Since the graph has no cycles, **take a path of greatest length from $u$ to $v$. Then, $u$ and $v$ must have degree 1, otherwise a longer path exists**
