$\bar{v} \cdot \bar{w} = **||\bar{v}|| \cdot ||\bar{w}|| \cdot \cos \theta**$ f
	Proof with **Law of Cosines**

	also provides method for determining when two vectors are orthogonal $\cos \theta = 0$

***

The dot product represents how vectors tend to **point in the same direction**
	0 is perpendicular, negative is opposite directions
