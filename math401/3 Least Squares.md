	also provides method for determining when two vectors are orthogonal $\cos \theta = 0$

The dot product represents how vectors tend to **point in the same direction**
	0 is perpendicular, negative is opposite directions

$||A_\hat{x} - b||$ is the square root of **the sum of the squares of the vertical distances**

We can't apply least squares to $y = \beta_0+ \beta_1 e^{\beta_2 x}$ since it's nonlinear. The workaround is to **try different manual values of $\beta_2$ and compare and try to minimize the least squares error**.
