An economically unfeasible situation occurs in a Leontief Input-Output model when **the column sums are greater than 1**, since **producing one unit of a product will consume more than 1 unit of the total products**.

The Leontief Input-Output Model is given by: **$\bar{p}=M\bar{p}+\bar{d}$**
> the matrix $M$ is the consumption matrix
> The consumption matrix is made up of consumption vectors. The j th column is the j th consumption vector and contains the necessary input required from each of the Sectors for Sector j to produce one unit of output.

Solving for $\bar{d}$ in the Leontief Input-Output model ($\bar{p}=M\bar{p}+\bar{d}$):
$\bar{p}=**(I-M)^{-1}\bar{d}**$
