# Exercise 1

## Part d

The graph of the populations tend towards the eigenvectors as time goes to positive infinity.

## Part f

$p = 0.4$; the eigenvalues are $0.6764, 1.1236$. The populations will grow because in the equation for an eigenvalue $A\vec{x} = \lambda \vec{x}$, once $\lambda > 1$ then $\vec{x}$ will increase.
