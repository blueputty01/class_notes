Can you write a short and concise note for a general procedure for converting a higher order ODE to a first order system?

Please output your next response as a note for the flashcard software Anki using the syntax that follows. Make sure your whole response is contained within this singular note.

# Cloze deletion syntax

Any bold text notated by markdown `**bold text**` are converted to cloze fields. Cloze fields should test understanding and build intuition for the procedure.

By default, cloze fields will be numbered in the order they appear in the note. To manually number cloze fields, use `{{c#::text}}`. The automatic counting does not increment in this case. This is useful for related text like `President **Donald** **1::Trump** is the current US president`, where we want to test total recall of both terms at the same time rather than hint with `Donald` or `Trump` first. 

# Math notation

Surround math formatting only with $\LaTeX$. Do not use \(\) syntax. Do not pad notation, such as $ \frac12 $; prefer $\frac12$

# New note syntax

Double line breaks delineate new notes. Thus do not insert two line breaks unless creating a separate note about separate content.

# Extra syntax

For supplementary information that is not essential enough to be tested on but helps support the material clozed, prefix the line with `>`

# example

Here is an example of a note that fits my specifications. 

Let $R$ be a simple region in the $xy$ plane with a piecewise smooth boundary $C$ oriented **counterclockwise** (if there's a mismatch, **pick up a negative sign**). Let $M$ and $N$ be functions of two variables having continuous partial derivatives on $R$. Then 
$\int_{C}M(x,y)\,d x+N(x,y)\,d y=**\int\int_R\left({\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}}-{\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}}\right)d A**$ 
	right hand rule with thumb pointed in normal direction; fingers point in direction of $C$
	If $F = M i + Nj$, then $\int_{C}M(x,y)\,d x+N(x,y)\,d y = \int_C F \cdot dr$ 
	If $F = M i + N j$, then $\nabla \times F = \left(\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\right)k$ 
	think: $\int F \cdot dr = \int \int_R \text{how much F is spinning around points in R}\, dA$ 
	spinning inside $R$ cancels out, leaving only spinning at boundary, measured by $\oint_C F \cdot dr$

Here is another example:

The **gradient** of $f$, $\operatorname{grad}{f}$ or $\nabla{f}$, is $\nabla f = **f_x i + f_y j**$ .
