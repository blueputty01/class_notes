DFS implementation:
{{c1::
```python
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
    return visited

>The function recursively explores all unvisited neighbors of the current node.
>The time complexity is O(V + E) where $V$ is the number of vertices and $E$ is the number of edges.

BFS implementation:
{{c1::
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)
    
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        print(vertex, end=" ")
        
        for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)

# Example usage
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}
bfs(graph, 'A')  # Output: A B C D E F
```
